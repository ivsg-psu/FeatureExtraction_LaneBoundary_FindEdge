%
% INPUTS:     
%       
%      gridCenters_greater_than_zero_point_density: the centers of the grid
%      with greater than zero point density, this means the grid is not empty. 
%
%      boundary_points_driven_path: boundary points that are near the
%      drivable path.
%
%      grids_greater_than_zero_points: grids with greater than zeros point
%      density, this means the gird is not empty.
%
%      total_N_points_in_each_grid: total numbers of points in each grid
%      
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%      input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%      up code to maximize speed.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%     total_points_in_each_grid_in_the_driven_path: the total points in
%     each grid of the drivable path.
%
%     total_points_in_each_grid_with_points_greater_than_zero: the total
%     points in each grid with greater than zero. This means the grid is
%     not empty.
