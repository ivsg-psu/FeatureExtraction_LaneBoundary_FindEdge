% FORMAT:
%
%      [X, Y, Z] = fcn_findEdge_prepGridCentersForBoundaryDetection...
%      (gridCenters_qualified_grids, gridCenters_unqualified_grids, varargin)
%
% INPUTS:     
%       
%      gridCenters_qualified_grids: grids that are qualified, these grids
%      are considered the real boundary points.
%
%      gridCenters_unqualified_grids: grids that are not qualified, these 
%      grids are not considered the real boundary points.
%      
%      (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%      fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%      input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%      up code to maximize speed.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
%      X: X meshgrid that contains qualified and unqualified_gridcenters
%
%      Y: Y meshgrid that contains qualified and unqualified_gridcenters
%
%      Z: Z meshgrid that contains qualified and unqualified_gridcenters
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
