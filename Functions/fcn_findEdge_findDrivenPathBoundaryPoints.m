%% fcn_findEdge_findDrivenPathBoundaryPoints    
% Find the boundary points of the driven path to create a bounding box for finding the driven path grids 
%
% FORMAT: 
% fcn_findEdge_findDrivenPathBoundaryPoints(VehiclePose, scanLineRange, Nscans, shift, (fig_num))
%
% INPUTS:
%       
%       VehiclePose: position of mapping vehicle during mapping.
%
%       scanLineRange: the range of scan lines of LIDAR data.
%
%       Nscans: numbers of scan lines.
%
%       shift: it is a scalar value that is applied to the vehicle's pose. 
%       This shift is used to adjust the position of the boundary points of 
%       the driven path relative to the vehicle's pose
%      
%       (OPTIONAL INPUTS)
%
%       fig_num: a figure number to plot results. If set to -1, skips any
%       input checking or debugging, no figures will be generated, and sets
%       up code to maximize speed.
%
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%
%       boundary_points_driven_path: the boundary points near the driving
%       path. This is an [Nx3] matrix.
%
% DEPENDENCIES:
%
%       (none)
